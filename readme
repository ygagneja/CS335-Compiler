abstract decl are not a part
bool and char are inherently is_type_int
no block stmts in global scope
level 0 and 1 have all level_id = 0
decl and defn must have same types and sym names
storage specifiers and type qualifiers not implemented
enum not implemented
strictness on return types of void and non void
ahead goto label throws error (label needs to be defined first)
cannot initialise arrays and structs during declaration itself (can initialise char* strings tho with string literal)
